A game created for [Pixel Game Jam 25](https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2025) by ShokTheIV

## About the Game

**Game Title**: Dead By Defence
**Theme**: From The Dead
**Development Time**: 10 days

The undead are rising from the graves on your island… and it’s up to you to stop them!

Build towers 🏰, blast the undead 💣, and protect your spooky island from total doom. But beware… 👻
Not everything can be seen—invisible ghosts will sneak right past your defenses if you’re not careful!
Think fast, build smart, and survive the night! 🌙🧠

Thought process💡:
When I heard the theme, I couldn't stop thinking about that one Gravity Falls episode. In that episode, Dipper accidentally summons the undead and defends the mystery shack with Mabel and Stan.
I wanted to create a similar feeling, although the game concept is oversimplified. The whole concept is to defend your island from the undead.
